  Crow Tech v4 testing

  Make use of Network.everywhere to perform network flooding.

  1. Gossip request: flood network so that all nests get the information.
  2. Request routing: network flooding is used to give all nests knowledge of
    the network connections. Using that, requests can be routed across the network
    and not just to neighbors, using a path-finding algorithm.
    Note: this implementation is flawed as it does not wait for the connections broadcast to
      finish. v5 fixes that.
